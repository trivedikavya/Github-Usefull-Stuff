> [!IMPORTANT]\
> Since the GitHub API only [allows ](https://docs.github.com), the public Vercel instance hosted on `https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api` could possibly hit the rate limiter (see [#1471](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats/issues/1471)). We use caching to prevent this from happening (see https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats#common-options). You can turn off these rate limit protections by deploying [your own Vercel instance](#disable-rate-limit-protections).
