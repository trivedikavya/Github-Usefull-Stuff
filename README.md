## 🚀 What is this?

This repository is a **Developer Experience (DX) Accelerator**. 
Instead of searching Google for "How to write a PR template" or "Best GitHub badges," you can find everything here in a modular, copy-paste-ready format.

**Our Philosophy:** 👀 **See it** → 📋 **Copy it** → 🎨 **Customize it.**
